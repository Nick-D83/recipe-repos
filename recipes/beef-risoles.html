    <h2 class="body heading">Cooking Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in medium saucepan and cover with water. Add a little salt. Bring to the boil and cook for 6 minutes, or until potatoes are tender but firm, being careful to not overcook them as they will be cooked again on the grill.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and return to the pan to dry and cool. Once cool enough to handle, cut into quarters.</li>
        <li>To make the dressing, mix mustard and white wine vinegar in a large bowl using a whisk. Slowly pour in the olive oil while whisking, until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. Add onion and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>For the rissoles, combine beef mince, onion, garlic, thyme, paprika, Worcestershire sauce and egg. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well and form into 8 round balls, then flatten into 1cm thick rissoles.</li>
        <li>Preheat BBQ or grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush rissoles with oil and cook for 6-8 minutes until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Remove from heat and rest for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>While rissoles are cooking, brush the potatoes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook until grill marks are achieved and the potatoes are starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Turn occasionally.</li>
        <li>Remove from grill and place in bowl with vinaigrette.</li>
        <li>To serve, add the spinach to the potatoes and gently toss to coat. Divide evenly among 4 plates and serve alongside rissoles. Drizzle with any remaining dressing.</li>
    </ol>
